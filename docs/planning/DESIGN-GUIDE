# plinking_duck — API Design Guide & Coding Standards

Cross-cutting design principles and implementation patterns for all
plinking_duck functions. Individual plan documents reference this guide
rather than duplicating conventions.

---

## 1. Core Architecture

### The .pgen is always the big data

The extension exists because .pgen files are too large and too specialized
to handle through generic DuckDB file readers. At target biobank scale:

| Data | Scale | Nature |
|------|-------|--------|
| .pgen genotypes | 10M+ samples × 170M variants, hundreds of GB to TB | **Big**: streams through pgenlib, never materialized |
| .pvar metadata | 170M rows × ~5 columns, ~10GB text | **Medium**: loaded into memory during bind |
| .psam metadata | 10M rows × ~10 columns, ~500MB text | **Medium**: loaded into memory during bind |
| Weights, phenotypes, covariates | 1–10M values, ~50–800MB | **Small**: passed as DuckDB values |

All extension functions take a .pgen path as their first positional argument.
The .pgen is the immovable center; everything else revolves around it.

### Reader functions vs utility functions

**Reader functions** (P1: `read_pvar`, `read_psam`, `read_pgen`, `read_pfile`)
expose raw file contents as DuckDB tables. They are for **inspection and
moderate-scale analysis**: examining variant metadata, checking sample info,
viewing genotypes for specific variants or small cohorts.

At biobank scale, `read_pgen` produces ~10MB per output row (one
`LIST(TINYINT)` with 10M entries per variant). A full scan of 170M variants
would produce ~1.7PB of genotype data. Tidy mode (`read_pfile` with
`tidy := true`) produces `N_variants × N_samples` rows — 1.7 trillion at
full scale. These functions are not designed for whole-genome computation.

**Utility functions** (P2: `plink_freq`, `plink_hardy`, `plink_missing`,
`plink_ld`, `plink_score`) perform genomics-specific computation using
pgenlib fast-paths that avoid full genotype decompression where possible.
They are the path for **biobank-scale computation**.

| Use Case | Function | Scale |
|----------|----------|-------|
| "What genotypes does sample X have at variant Y?" | `read_pfile` + WHERE | Small |
| "Show me variants on chromosome 22" | `read_pvar` + WHERE | Medium |
| "Compute allele frequencies for all variants" | `plink_freq` | Biobank |
| "Compute per-sample missingness" | `plink_missing` | Biobank |
| "Score 10M samples with 1M variant weights" | `plink_score` | Biobank |

## 2. Parameter Conventions

### Positional arguments

Every function takes the .pgen (or pfile prefix) path as its first and only
positional argument. All other inputs are named parameters.

### Shared named parameters

These parameters have consistent names, types, and semantics across all
functions that use them:

| Parameter | Type | Semantics | Used By |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|
| `pvar` | VARCHAR | Explicit .pvar/.bim path (overrides auto-discovery) | read_pgen, read_pfile, all P2 |
| `psam` | VARCHAR | Explicit .psam/.fam path (overrides auto-discovery) | read_pgen, read_pfile, all P2 |
| `samples` | LIST(VARCHAR) or LIST(INTEGER) | Filter to specific samples (by IID or 0-based index) | read_pgen, read_pfile, all P2 |
| `region` | VARCHAR | Filter to genomic region (`chr:start-end`) | read_pfile, P2-001–P2-005 |
| `variants` | LIST(VARCHAR) or LIST(INTEGER) | Filter to specific variants (by ID or 0-based index) | read_pfile *(planned)* |

#### Type dispatch for filter parameters

The `samples` and `variants` parameters accept either string IDs or integer
indices, determined by the parameter's DuckDB type at bind time:

| Parameter Type | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| `LIST(VARCHAR)` | Match by ID: look up IID (samples) or variant ID (variants) in the companion file metadata. Error on unknown ID. |
| `LIST(INTEGER)` | Match by 0-based index: index directly into the .pgen's internal sample/variant ordering. Error if any index is out of range (>= `raw_sample_ct` or `raw_variant_ct`). |

Integer indices bypass ID lookup entirely — they map directly to pgenlib's
internal 0-based ordering. This is useful for:
- **Quick inspection**: `samples := [0, 49]` without needing to know IIDs
- **Orphaned .pgen files**: when no .psam exists (see §2.1 below), integer
  indices are the only way to select specific samples
- **Programmatic access**: when indices have been resolved externally

```sql
-- By name
SELECT * FROM read_pfile('data/example', tidy := true, samples := ['SAMPLE1']);

-- By 0-based index (same sample if SAMPLE1 is first in .psam)
SELECT * FROM read_pfile('data/example', tidy := true, samples := [0]);

-- Integer variant indexing
SELECT * FROM read_pgen('data/example.pgen', variants := [0, 3]);
```

**Mixing types is not allowed**: a single `samples` or `variants` parameter
must be entirely VARCHAR or entirely INTEGER. To combine, resolve IDs to
indices (or vice versa) before passing.

#### Error behavior for filter parameters

**`samples` not found**: Error with the unknown sample ID (VARCHAR mode) or
out-of-range index (INTEGER mode). Partial matches are not accepted. This is
consistent across all functions.

**`region` with no matches**: Returns 0 rows (not an error). A region that
doesn't overlap any variants is a valid query with an empty result.

**`variants` not found**: Behavior depends on context. For readers
(`read_pfile`), error on unknown variant ID or out-of-range index. For
utility functions where partial matching is expected (e.g., `plink_score`
ID-keyed weights), skip with a warning count.

### Optional companion files

The .pgen binary contains a sample count (`raw_sample_ct`) and variant count
(`raw_variant_ct`) in its header. Companion files (.pvar, .psam) provide
metadata (names, positions, phenotypes) but are not strictly required for
genotype access.

**Policy for `read_pgen`**: The .psam file is **optional**. If no .psam is
found (and none is provided via the `psam` parameter), `read_pgen` operates
in **index-only mode**:
- Genotype lists still work (sized by `raw_sample_ct` from the .pgen header)
- The `samples` parameter only accepts `LIST(INTEGER)`, not `LIST(VARCHAR)`
  (there are no IIDs to match against)
- Projection pushdown still applies

The .pvar file remains **required** for `read_pgen` because variant metadata
columns (CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT) are part of the output schema. Without
.pvar, the function can only output genotype lists with no variant context.
A future enhancement could make .pvar optional with synthetic row indices,
but this is not planned for P1.

**Policy for `read_pfile`**: Both .pvar and .psam are **required** because
the function's purpose is to unify all three files. Use `read_pgen` for
.pgen-only access.

**Policy for P2 utility functions**: Same as `read_pgen` — .psam is optional
when the function doesn't need sample metadata in its output (e.g.,
`plink_freq`, `plink_hardy` produce per-variant output). Functions that
produce per-sample output (`plink_score`, `plink_missing` sample mode)
require .psam for IID output columns unless operating in index-only mode.

### Three-tier type dispatch for small data

Parameters that accept user-provided data (weights, phenotypes, covariates,
population labels) follow a three-tier type dispatch:

| Tier | Type | When to Use | Status |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `LIST(DOUBLE)`, `LIST(VARCHAR)` | Positional, small/filtered, tests | P2 |
| 2 | `LIST(STRUCT(...))` or `STRUCT(LIST(...), ...)` | ID-keyed or multi-column | P2 |
| 3 | `VARCHAR` (table name) | Data too large to materialize as Value | P3 |

**Tier 1 (positional)**: Values aligned with .pgen variant or sample order.
Fast path — no ID matching. Length must match the expected count (or
region-filtered count).

**Tier 2 (ID-keyed or multi-column)**: Struct field names serve as the
column contract. No separate `id_col`/`weight_col` parameters.
- `LIST(STRUCT(...))` (list-of-structs): row-oriented, best for sparse
  ID-keyed data (e.g., variant weights matched by ID)
- `STRUCT(LIST(...), ...)` (struct-of-lists): column-oriented, best for
  positional multi-column data (e.g., covariates), aligns with DuckDB's
  columnar internals

**Tier 3 (table name)**: Extension executes `context.Query()` during bind
to stream from a named DuckDB table. Column names must match the struct
field contract. For data too large to materialize as a single DuckDB Value.

**Value sourcing**: For Tiers 1–2, values can come from:
- Literals: `weights := [1.0, 0.5, -0.5]`
- Variables: `SET VARIABLE w = (...); ... weights := getvariable('w')`
- Scalar subqueries (when DuckDB supports this for table function params)

The extension receives a materialized `Value` and does not know or care
how it was produced.

## 3. Output Column Conventions

### Variant metadata columns

All functions that output variant information use these column names:

| Column | DuckDB Type | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| CHROM | VARCHAR | .pvar |
| POS | INTEGER | .pvar (1-based) |
| ID | VARCHAR | .pvar |
| REF | VARCHAR | .pvar |
| ALT | VARCHAR | .pvar |

### Sample metadata columns

All functions that output sample information use these column names:

| Column | DuckDB Type | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| FID | VARCHAR | .psam (optional — may be absent) |
| IID | VARCHAR | .psam (always present) |

### Join compatibility

P1 reader output and P2 utility output use the same column names, so they
compose naturally:

```sql
-- Join frequency data with variant metadata
SELECT v.ID, v.REF, v.ALT, f.ALT_FREQ
FROM read_pvar('data/example.pvar') v
JOIN plink_freq('data/example.pgen') f USING (CHROM, POS, ID);

-- Join scores with sample metadata
SELECT s.IID, s.SCORE_SUM, p.SEX
FROM plink_score('data/example.pgen', weights := ...) s
JOIN read_psam('data/example.psam') p USING (IID);
```

## 4. Extension Scope Boundary

### The extension handles

- Binary .pgen genotype access (pgenlib fast-paths)
- Genomics-specific computation (HWE exact test, LD correlation, PRS scoring)
- .pvar and .psam text parsing (format-specific, not general-purpose)
- RAII wrappers around pgenlib's C memory management

### The extension does NOT handle

- External file format parsing (CSV, Parquet, JSON — DuckDB handles this)
- Multiple testing correction (SQL window functions suffice)
- Data management (filtering, sorting, joining — SQL handles these)
- Matrix output (GRM, kinship matrices — not a natural table function output)

### When SQL suffices, don't add a function

Before adding a new function, ask: can this be expressed as a SQL query
on existing function output? Examples:

- Genotyping rate: `SELECT 1 - AVG(F_MISS) FROM plink_missing(...)`
- Het rate per sample: expressible via `read_pfile(tidy := true)` + GROUP BY
- Multiple testing correction: SQL window functions on p-values
- LD pruning: SQL query on `plink_ld` output to select independent variants

A dedicated function is justified when:
1. It uses a pgenlib fast-path that avoids full genotype decompression
2. The computation is non-trivial and genomics-specific
3. The SQL alternative would be orders of magnitude slower

## 5. Implementation Patterns

### pgenlib initialization

Two-phase init, shared across all functions:

```
PreinitPgfi(&pgfi)
PgfiInitPhase1(path, ...) → raw_variant_ct, raw_sample_ct
allocate pgfi_alloc (cache-aligned)
PgfiInitPhase2(...) → max_vrec_width, pgr_alloc_cacheline_ct
```

P2-001 extracts this into `PgenContext` in `plink_common.hpp`.

### Per-thread PgenReader

pgenlib readers are NOT thread-safe. Each DuckDB scan thread creates its
own PgenReader with its own cache-aligned working memory:

```cpp
allocate pgr_alloc (pgr_alloc_cacheline_ct * kCacheline, cache-aligned)
PgrInit(filename, max_vrec_width, &pgfi, &pgr, pgr_alloc)
```

PgenFileInfo is shared (immutable after init).

### RAII memory management

Use `unique_ptr` with custom deleters for all pgenlib resources. Never
rely on manual cleanup in destructors — the cascading-cleanup pattern is
error-prone (see P0-003 for examples).

```cpp
struct PgfiDeleter { void operator()(PgenFileInfo* p) { ... } };
struct PgrDeleter { void operator()(PgenReader* p) { ... } };
using UniquePgfi = unique_ptr<PgenFileInfo, PgfiDeleter>;
```

Cache-aligned allocations (`cachealigned_malloc`) must be freed with
`aligned_free`, not `free`.

### Parallel scan with atomic batch claiming

All variant-parallel functions use atomic batch claiming to reduce
contention:

```
BATCH_SIZE = 128  // tune per function
while rows_emitted < STANDARD_VECTOR_SIZE:
    batch_start = global.next_variant_idx.fetch_add(BATCH_SIZE)
    if batch_start >= end_idx: break
    for vidx in batch_start..min(batch_start + BATCH_SIZE, end_idx):
        // process variant
```

For functions requiring full-scan-then-emit (plink_missing sample mode,
plink_score), use per-thread accumulation arrays with a merge step after
all threads complete.

### Projection pushdown

Reader functions MUST support projection pushdown. If genotype columns
are not in the projection, do NOT call `PgrGet()`. This makes metadata-only
queries orders of magnitude faster.

Check `column_ids` from `TableFunctionInitInput` to determine which
columns are needed.

---

## 6. Testing Standards

### Test format

All tests use DuckDB's `.test` format with `require plinking_duck`.

### Coverage requirements

Each function needs:
- **Positive tests**: known-answer tests with hand-calculated expected values
- **Negative tests**: file not found, invalid parameters, type errors
- **Edge cases**: empty results, all-missing data, boundary conditions
- **Parameter interaction**: filtering + subsetting combined

### Validation against plink2

P2 utility functions should be validated against plink2's output for the
same computation (within floating-point tolerance). Document the plink2
command used for validation in the test file.

---

## 7. Documentation Standards

### README.md

Each function gets a section in README.md with:
- Function signature with parameter list
- 2-3 example SQL queries showing common use cases
- Brief description of what the function does

### Code comments

- Document non-obvious logic only
- Document the pgenlib API call pattern (which function, what it returns)
- Document thread safety model
- Test files serve as usage examples
